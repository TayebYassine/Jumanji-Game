# JUMANJI - Modular SDL2 Game

This game is designed with the SDL2 library for C, and Jumanji features a 2D adventure with a game mode!

This project is not affiliated with the actual movie, yet it used some assets to design the game for the final
university semester project!

Pull requests from people excluding the project group will be immediately rejected and closed.
